## NetLogoLab and the GoGo Board Extension for sensors and robotics

This is the extension for physical computing, using sensors, motors, etc in NetLogo. It interfaces with GoGo boards running Human Interface Driver (HID) firmware, and it replaces the old GoGo Extension, which used USB-serial communications. (The USB-serial GoGo extension is still available for NetLogo 5.3.1 and earlier [here](https://github.com/NetLogo/GoGo-Serial-Extension).)

This extension comes bundled with NetLogo 5.2 and later.  The source code is hosted online at
